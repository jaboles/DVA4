<h3>New in This Version</h3>

DVA has many new features in its latest version. Here they are:

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> Enhanced Playback</b>
<br>DVA now uses Windows to play its sound files. In previous versions, it launched an external DOS program to play its sounds. The newer way to play is much faster and more bug-free, since it is built right into Windows. Of course, if you want to play the old way, you can now...

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> Compile to an MS-DOS batch file</b>
<br>DVA now allows you to compile to an MS-DOS batch file. You may want to do this if you have a slow computer and playing the file through Windows results in too low quality.

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> Full-featured Built-in Text Editor</b>
<br>As of version 4.00, you can now edit DVA (and MVA) files right from within the DVA program. The DVA program now has facilities for finding a string of text, and searching-and-replacing.

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> Quick-build List Box</b>
<br>As well as writing your files in the the normal way with the built in editor, you can very quickly create your files with the list box appearing at the side of the window. This box contains every file in your default sounds directory. Simply double click a file to add it to the editing area at the insertion point. This makes it very quick and easy to create a DVA or MVA file. It also eliminates the need to test the file, since only files that are there and accessible are used.

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> MVA-compatible</b>
<br>You can now play and compile your MVA files in DVA. DVA lets you open, save and print any MVA file.

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> Customisable 100% Shell Integration</b>
<br>DVA includes shell integration which is also customisable. There are right-click menu items for opening, playing, or compiling a file, and you can specify which action is the default, for when the file is double-clicked.

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> Windows Compatibility</b>
<br>Because DVA is now written in Rapid-Q, a 32-bit compiler, it is compatible fully with Windows. You can share text on the clipboard, use long filenames, and fully consistent dialogs for operations such as opening and saving are implemented.

<p><img src="onestep.gif" border=0><b> Elimination of Index File</b>
<br>Version 4 of DVA eliminates the need for an index file. In previous versions, lack of long filename support meant that an index file was mandatory for all the sounds to play correctly. DVA's Windows compatibility now means that this requirement is completely eliminated.
