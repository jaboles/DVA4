<h3>Version History</h3>
<b>v0.40b</b><br>Fourth generation. Operates fully in Windows 32-bit GUI. No more DOS! Also no more index files. Extensive MVA support, built in editor and quick-builder, customisable shell integration, enhanced playback and ability to compile MVA/DVA files to BATch files.<p>
<b>v0.40a</b><br>Fourth generation alpha for beta version 4 above.<p>
<b>v3.0x</b><br>Even greater user customisability. The user-customised data is stored in the file user.dat, which also speeds up the upgrade process, as the entire wads.dat file doesn't have to be searched through and edited by the program. More sounds from Sydney, as well as Brisbane now. Even more DVA example files. Included a brand new logo and title animation with sound too! Now for the most inportant upgrade, new one-click DVA Autoplay and Upgrade! Now you can upgrade or play DVA files from anywhere. Right-click context menu in Explorer added.<p>
<b>v0.30</b> - Third generation beta<br>Experimental beta for third generation (3.x) version, implementing full Explorer Shell integration.<p>
<b>v2.11</b><br>Added more sounds, and updated icons.dll file.<p>
<b>v2.10</b><br>Included a splash screen to display at startup. Also added some more DVA example files. Abolished run-time compiler, after recovering a corrupted file from the net. Created a new play engine, to make upgrades easier and to let the user add his/her own sounds.<p>
<b>v2.03</b><br>Now I seem to have found a setup program THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!! Also includes more station data. Created a unique file type for the DVA data (.wad), and a fancy new icon for it! Worked out how to use setup compression, reducing the file size by 40%.<p>
<b>v2.02</b><br>Version created, but even more problems with setup programs, and was not released.<p>
<b>v2.01</b><br>Due to serious faults with the setup creator, the method of distribution is reverted to a zip file.<p>
<b>v2.00</b> - First full release<br>No full data, but fixed bugs in recognising 'Wentworth Falls' and 'Milsons Point' in source files. Added a Setup executable to replace the zip file, and broke up the volumes into pieces in case of a mishap during downloading. Also added some snazzy new icons, an uninstall, and an internet shortcut.<p>
<b>v0.20</b> - Second beta<br>Again experimental. Brightened up the interface. Don't have full data yet though.<p>
<b>v0.10</b> - First beta<br>Experimental version. Minimal data included.<p>
