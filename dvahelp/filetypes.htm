<h3>File Types</h3>

DVA has several related file types. They are listed here.


<p><b>DVA Source file</b>: These files are what you create when you write a source and then save it. They have the extension '.dva'. These files are ASCII text so you can use any non-formatting text editor such as Windows Notepad to edit them, besides editing them from within DVA.

<p><b>MVA Source file</b>: These files are source files created by a program similar to DVA called MVA, and hence have the extension '.mva'. DVA has the ability to open, save, play and compile MVA files as you would a DVA file. MVA files are also plain ASCII text and can be edited with any text editor as well as from within DVA.

<p><b>DVA Wave Data file</b>: These are the sound bites which are put together to make an announcement. You can add your own simply by creating an uncompressed wave-sound file (.wav), renaming it to a DVA Wave Data file and placing it in your sounds directory. DVA Wave Data files have the extension '.wad'. A compressed type of DVA Wave Data files may be implemented in future versions and this will have the extension '.cwd' (compressed wave data).
