<h3>The Great Leap Forward</h3>

<p>DVA has come a long way from its roots. Development began in 1999 with the concept of DVA being realised in the form of an MS-DOS batch file. Since then, until today, DVA has passed through the hands of MS-DOS Batch, QuickBasic, Turbo Pascal, and Turbo Pascal for Windows and has been through three major version numbers. Now DVA is written in Rapid-Q and has reached version number 4. Each new version has seen new features added and hence this version is the most enhanced and advanced version to date; each new version has really been a 'great leap forward'.
