<h3>About DVA</h3>

<p>DVA stands for Digital Voice Announcement. It is a program which lets you create announcements as used at CityRail stations all over Sydney. The DVA distribution package consists of the actual DVA program, hundreds of CityRail sounds, and sample source files to get you started. DVA can also be used to run any public address system (provided you have the right sounds) in places such as shopping centres or theatres.
